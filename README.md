## RSA Factoring Challenge

# General
* The RSA algorithm is a public-key cryptosystem.
* This means that there are two keys, a public key, and a private key.
* The private key is known only by the owner and is used for decryption.
* The RSA algorithm is asymmetric. which means that the keys are different.
* RSA algorithm is based on the fact that it is difficult to factorize large numbers.

*Mission/Objective:* *Your mission should you choose to accept it, is to factorize these numbers as fast as possible before the target fixes this bug on their server - so that we can decode the encrypted documents.
